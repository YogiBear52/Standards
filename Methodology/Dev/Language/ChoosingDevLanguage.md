# Choosing the Right Programming Language

## General Considerations

- External Community
- Internal Organization Community
- Learning Curve. Quick Start ?
- Who's behind it (Microsoft/Apple/Google/ one Asian guy)
- Trend
- Development Environment - IDE, Windows/Linux
- Quality of the language
  - Strongly Typed
  - Readable
  - Is it stable? How old is the language?
    - X < 5 ; 5 < X < 10 ; X > 10
  - Ecosystem - Connection with other language/libraries

## Project related considerations

- Type of software - Desktop reach client / Server / Mobile ?
- CPU-Bound / Memory Bound / IO ?
- Data Oriented?
- Cross Platform

## Programming Language

- Typescript - (EcmaScript)
  - Server, Client and Reach client
  - Not CPU-Bound, very IO-Bound
  - One language. Reduce the Tech-Stack
  - Typescript is very popular, large community --> Support + External libraries
  - Lang Quality --> oop and strongly typed
    - Zero base libraries
  - Good ecosystem
  - Microsoft takes it seriously as a main project
- Python
  - Data oriented, Machine learning, AI, Data Science, Networking community and libraries
  - Low Quality Lang
  - Quick start
  - Good to know nowadays
- Java
  - Java is going to die. Say bye bye
- C#, .Net Core
  - Gaming unity, Reach client, Server
  - When using best practices(non-blocking thread), best performing framework.
  - Lang Quality -> Very good mark, oop + strongly typed
  - Small community
  - Microsoft stand behinds.
  - One of the oldest and most stable lang on the market
- Go Lang
  - Will replace C++
  - Very newbie lang, supported by Google so there is a hype
  - Don't use it for web development
- Php
  - Don't even consider.
  - But if you do consider, please get out of this Repo, it's not for you kiddy

### Quality Marks

Unfortunately the quality of the lang become less and less important, since new programmers are born into Javascript, lean so much shit and bad practices so they don't appreciate quality.

- Best: Haskell
- Not Bad: F#, Lua, Rust, Swift
- Mid: C#, Clojure, Typescript, Scala
- Bad: C, Java, Python
- Horrible: Php, css, bash

## What Lang Should I learn?

- OOP + Python + C + TS
- Knowing the difference between langs.
- Adopting the strong parts of each lang and Framework.
- DO NOT EVER START LEARNING PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON OR PURE JAVASCRIPT - you will build bad coding habits
