# Npm

- All your third-party dependencies suppose to be taken from an organized repo such as npm.

## Npm Commands

The universal convention is the use the standard npm commands:

- "npm start" - server the app/server in non-debug mode
- "npm stop" - stops the app/server
- "npm pack" - makes a RELEASE-ready artifact
- "npm test" - will run static code unit tests of your project's code

For debug purposes make your own commands.

## Client - NPM vs Yarn

(?? More details because nowadays it's not that obvious to go with yarn)
