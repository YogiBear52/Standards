## [Infrastructure as a Code](https://www.thorntech.com/2018/01/infrastructureascodebenefits/)

Put everything you can as a CODE in your REPO:

- Source Code
- Pipeline code
  - Building Scripts
  - Testing Scripts
  - Deployment scripts
- Docker & K&S
  - OS
  - Third Party installations (NodeJs,.Net Runtime,Python ..)
  - LoadBalancer
  - ApiGateway

Benefits of IaaC:

- Not putting you infrastructure as a Code mean you set them manually - which is is dark and full of terrors
- Easy and Fast to modify
- Part of your ONE Artifact
- Easy to upgrade OS layers (Upgrade OS version, Upgrade os installations)
