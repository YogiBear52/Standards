# Routines

Make you CI agents work hard and keep the busy as much as you can

There are few routines that can be done

## Nightly

Wake up to a new day with nice tech report.

- Run all tests (Full, not just Sanity)
- Run them on master branch

## Production

Constantly run sanity checks on your production env. Make sure the reports are reflected to your logs which are reflected to your monitors system.

This is the best, most quality and reality, pro active Health Check you can do to you env. All other monitors are way less important.
