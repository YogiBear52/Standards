- Add Search bar, especially for large sites.
- Sticky “back-to-top” buttons
- (?) Use breadcrumbs to let your visitors know where they are

## [Accessibility](https://www.nibusinessinfo.co.uk/content/web-accessibility-issues)

[Free tools to check WebSite accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/)

- Provide alternative text to graphic content
- Provide captions, narrations or transcripts for media - this applies to videos, archived audios as well as live audio.
- (Controversial BP) In Don't use colour to convey meaning - colour is a strong design element, but you should avoid using it to convey information. It will be inaccessible to colour-blind people, as well as screen readers.
- Color contrast
  - Especially with background
  - Make sure you can notice all details on page on remote screens.
