# Legacy Products

The rule is simple, if there are active clients and the development is stopped - the clients will no be satisfied.

Legacy code/product is sometimes treated as a sickness. Slowly it becomes a garbage that nobody wants to touch. This is not a situation we want because it's an important asset to your organization.

If this product is important to the business and you are willing to continue with it, you must invest time to constantly develop and maintain it.

Thus you have three options:

- Keep fully develop it until you decide it is not worthwhile to the business anymore.
- Totally stop supporting the product and put it out of service.
- Develope it. Invest at least 20%-40% of you team time while developing the replacement product.
  - The team/group that develope the next replacement, should be the one maintaining the current "Legacy" one.
    - Otherwise, there will be no motivation to the keep clients of the "Legacy" product satisfied.

Saying goodbye to a product is not an easy decision, investing 40% of your time on developing an old asset while not investing the time in a new product it's also an hard decision.

But you cannot have it both way, and keep the product alive and not investing it resources. It just doesn't work this way.
